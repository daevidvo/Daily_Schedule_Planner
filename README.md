## Description 

[Click to View the Deployed Site](https://daevidvo.github.io/Daily_Schedule_Planner/)

It's not uncommon to believe that having a detailed schedule laid out for the day can help boost productivity.

That's why I built this simple and lightweight planner for anyone to use! 

Now, through the power of jQuery, Day.js, and JavaScript, we can plan out our day and have that information persist session to session.

## Learning Points

There were many valuable lessons as a developer that allowed me to create this website. However, I believe the most important lessons was simply learning how to use jQuery and Day.js

### **jQuery**

The majority of the DOM manipulation and traversing in this project was done through the use of jQuery.

Having gone through the roughs of jQuery, I found that it is a useful tool in shortening the amount of overall JavaScript that I have to write because of the many integrated functions in jQuery for adding elements, manipulating them, and traversing.

### **Day.js**

This is fairly self explanatory since Day.js doesn't have a lot of complicated functionality. 

Used mainly to figure out the current hour and to display the time in the planner, it's useful to know in case I build software in the future that require time-based functions.
